hibernation occurs when an animal needs to conserve energy to get through the food-scare months of winter.	hibernation	hibernation	1
hibernation is caused by several things.	hibernation	hibernation	1
animals put on fat which is necessary for hibernation.	hibernation	hibernation	9
hibernation is caused by cold, winter conditions.	hibernation	hibernation	1
the purpose of hibernation is to escape the need to burn too much fuel to stay alive during a cold spell when adequate food is not available.	hibernation	hibernation	4
