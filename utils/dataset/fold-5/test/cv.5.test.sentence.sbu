hibernation occurs when an animal needs to conserve energy to get through the food-scare months of winter.
hibernation is caused by several things.
animals put on fat which is necessary for hibernation.
hibernation is caused by cold, winter conditions.
the purpose of hibernation is to escape the need to burn too much fuel to stay alive during a cold spell when adequate food is not available.
the occurrence of sleep, shallow torpor and hibernation depends on factors such as the environmental temperature, amounts of body fat, extemal.
hibernation is caused by daylight and temperature.
hibernation occurs when the insects are maintained under autumn conditions.
impaired muscle regeneration in hibernation is caused by inhibition of satellite cell activation and myoblast differentiation.
the purpose of hibernation is to conserve energy during a period when sufficient food is scarce.
